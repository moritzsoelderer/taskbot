**Idea: TaskBot, the Kitchen Assistance Robot**

The idea behind TaskBot is to create a kitchen assistance robot. This robot is designed to help in the kitchen by performing simple tasks, like grabbing utensils or tidying up. It is a helpful solution for making kitchen work more efficient and organized. 

**Use case 1 :**

Gives person matching items to the one just used. E.g. cutting board --> knife

**Use case 2:**

Tidying up objects after use. Recognizing whether a person is finished with a task (images or user feedback). E.g. used knife --> sink

**Milestones:**

1. Recognize currently used items
2. Grasp objects
3. Recognize task state
4. Interactively help user 

**Implementation:**
- 3D print items --> add QR-Codes for position & recognition
- Grid for items
- Robot grasps items
- LLM: queried to get task state (in progress / done)
- Query user for feedback: "Are you done with the task?" --> "Yes"/"No"
- Robot act depending on state

**Hardware needed:**
- Robot
- 3D printed items (kitchen items)
- Camera
- Speaker
- Microphone

**HOW TO: Add new script**
- Create script (<em>your_script.py</em>) inside of a catkin package under <em>your_package</em>/scripts
- Run `catkin_make` (optional?)
- Make script executable: `sudo chmod +x your_script.py`
- If necessary allow permission for usb-port: `sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0`
- Run script: `rosrun your_package your_script.py`
